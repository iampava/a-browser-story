            Last summer I started getting increasingly interested in front-end performance. But I didn't want to just
            read about making fast apps, I wanted to deep-dive and optimize something real! On the other hand, I was
            finding it more and more annoying to manage the code-review process of my trainings. So, I
            decided to chase both metaphorical rabbits and learn about performance by building the app that
            would also make my trainings better...
        </p>
        <p>Over time this "chase" turned into something real: <a href="https://devdrive.io">DevDrive</a>. And since now
            I'm pretty happy with the overall
            performance, I decided to look back and write about what techniques helped me the most.</p>
        <p class="tip tip--info">
            DevDrive is written in React but all the ideas here can be applied to pretty much any usecase.

        <h2> Code splitting </h2>
        <p>As you continue adding features to your app, your code-base will get bigger and bigger. At first nothing
            will be very obvious, but as your app gets increasingly complex you'll surely notice that it takes longer
            to start. And it kinda makes sense, because more JavaScript means longer times for download, parse, compile
            and execution.</p>
        <p> However, we surely don't need all that code from the get-go. To be more specific, if I'm building an
            SPA, I don't need the code for the <strong>/settings</strong> page if I'm not even logged in yet. Or let's
            say you build a one-page app with tons of functionalities, like an airline booking system. I don't use the
            code that
            searches for my flight until I have actually wrote my journey details and pressed <strong>Find</strong>.
            But all this
            code which I don't need still gets sent down the network and is parsed by the JavaScript engine. You might
            argue that it's not executed and you'd be correct, but even so we're still wasting time which only gets
            more and more
            obvious on low-end devices.</p>
        <p> The solution is to split our bundle in multiple, smaller files - usually called chunks - which we'll load
            just when we need them, thus
            having the overall app start much faster. </p>
        <blockquote class="reader-quote">But, which parts do we split and which do we keep together?</blockquote>
        <h3 class="topic">1) Route-based code splitting</h3>
        <p> This is what pretty much every article and blog post out there recommends and I'll mention it here just in
            case you never stumbled upon it. This technique applies to SPAs and suggests that we create one chunk per
            route. So we'll have one for the <strong>/landing</strong> page, one for <strong>/home</strong>, one for
            <strong>/settings</strong> and so on. This way,
            when you navigate to the app we only send you the code for that particular page.
        </p>
        <p>I implemented this technique in <a href="https://devdrive.io">DevDrive</a> with the help of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>
            and the
            <a href="https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable">React-loadable</a> package.
            In the <span class="formatted">Pages.lazy.jsx</span> file I defines components that, when mounted,
            request the real component from the network and then make the switch.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">import Loadable from 'react-loadable';

// Landing page
const LazyLandingPage = Loadable({
    loader: () => import('./landing/Landing.page'),
    modules: ['./landing/Landing.page'],
    webpack: () => [require.resolveWeak('./landing/Landing.page')]
});
const LazyLanding =  props => &#60;LazyLandingPage {...props} />;

// Home page
const LazyHomePage = Loadable({
    loader: () => import('./home/Home.page'),
    modules: ['./home/Home.page'],
    webpack: () => [require.resolveWeak('./home/Home.page')]
});
const LazyHome = props => &#60;LazyHomePage {...props} />;

export {
    LazyLanding,
    LazyHome
};</code></pre>
        <br />
        <p> Then, in my Routes definitions, I use those components instead of the real ones: </p>
        <br />
        <pre><code class="javascript">import {
    LazyLanding,
    LazyHome
} from './pages/Pages.lazy';

class Root extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            &#60;Switch>
                &#60;Route exact path="https://iampava.com/" component={LazyLanding} />
                &#60;Route exact path="https://iampava.com/home" component={LazyHome} />
            &#60;/Switch>
        )
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Angular and Vue support it out of the box and even if you're building your own SPA, it should be pretty
            simple to implement it yourself by leveraging <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import">dynamic
                imports</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="topic">2) Functionality-based code splitting</h3>
        <p> Now that we've added route-based splitting, it's time to move even further by looking at the individual
            functionalities within a page. In terms of DevDrive, there are some scenarios which demand a simple modal.
            I
            haven't implemented it myself, rather I'm using the <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/">SweetAlert2</a>
            library which weighs <strong>70KB</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>The catch: I'm not showing the modal right away!</blockquote>
        <p>
            So I split this library from the main bundle - using dynamic imports. The dynamic import returns a <span
                class="formatted">Promise</span> where I can use the module via the
            <span class="formatted">default</span> property
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">function onClick() {
  import('../Swal.service').then(SwalService => {
    SwalService.default(
        /* ... */
    );
  });
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            A good place to see it in action is the <strong>/join-team</strong> page where, if you're authenticated,
            those
            <strong>70KB</strong> are never sent!
        </p>
        <h3 class="topic">3) Component-based code splitting</h3>
        <p> But that's not all! Thanks to my shitty phone and a poor connection I discovered that it takes quite a
            while to load the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco
                Editor</a> plugin - this is what I'm using to write & edit code in the browser. It weighs <strong>2.6MB</strong>
            which is really huge! I haven't been able to reduce it's size - I'm thinking it's a bug on their side -
            plus, I'm
            showing the editor straight away, unlike the SweetAlert library, so the solution above doesn't really
            apply.
        </p>
        <p> Still, if we slightly adjust the first solution it will kinda help here too. So, I ended up splitting the
            component into a separate file and showing a placeholder text while it loads. Although technically it
            takes the same amount of time until you can use it, now the rest
            of the page loads faster so you can start reading the exercise right away. Plus, chances are that the
            editor is
            fully loaded until you scroll there.

        <p> I'd say this is especially true when optimizing apps. The usual downside is that the code gets more
            complicated and less friendly for new developers joining the team. However, in terms of
            code-splitting there's a disadvantage to the experience itself: <strong>Waiting for the other chunk to
                reach the app.</strong> </p>
        <p>In terms of route-based code splitting this might be
            neglectable but when it comes to the second scenario, most users expect instant responses.
        </p>

            <span class="media__about">Loading the SweetAlert library is not instant</span>

        <p> As you can see above, the user has to wait quite some time for the modal to show which is definitely not
            what he/she expects. If we have multiple functionalities like this, all of the sudden the app starts fast
            but we have to wait every time we want to do something... Clearly not good!
        </p>
        <p>

            I addressed this problem by downloading and caching all the chunks behind the scenes via a <a href="https://devdrive.io/service-worker.js">Service
                Worker</a>. This way I make sure you get them instantly when you request them.
            There's still gonna be the cost of parsing and executing the code but my assumption is that most chunks
            will be fairly small so this is one cost I'm happy spending.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/resources-manifest-webpack-plugin">resource-manifest-webpack-plugin</a>
            which creates a JSON file with the names of the outputted assets. Then, from the Service Worker, I read the
            JSON and cache
            all the files specified there.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">self.addEventListener('install', function onInstall(event) {
    event.waitUntil(caches.open('devdrive-cache')
        .then(cache => fetch('/resources-manifest.json')
            .then(resp => resp.json())
            .then(jsonResp => cache.addAll(jsonResp.TO_CACHE))
            .then(resolve)

        <h2> Best tool for the job </h2>
        <p> Another problem I encountered, although not in DevDrive but in another project, was the size of 3rd party
            dependencies. I needed a basic horizontal slider with touch support and stumbled upon <a href="https://idangero.us/swiper/">Swiper</a>.
            Happy with their
            good documentation and easy-to-use API, I quickly integrated it into the project. Later that day I
            rememberer
            I haven't checked the size of the library, so I quickly navigated to <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">Bundlephobia</a>,
            and to my shock discovered it weighs <strong>119 KB</strong>.

    <section id="ssr">
        <h2>Server Side Rendering</h2>
        <p> I clearly remember how big of a deal SSR was early on. I was very excited to finally
            give it a try in the context of React and DevDrive. However, although it started and it still is just a
            side-project, it had to be in a working version until <time datetime="2018-10-01">October 2018</time>
            when the school year would have started
            and with it the front-end labs I teach. So unfortunately I had to also focus on some features and didn't
            manage to fully implement SSR the way I was envisioning it...
        </p>
        <p> However, I managed to add just a tiny bit of it, which shaved around <strong>200 milliseconds</strong>
            on the start
            time. Let me tell you how:
        </p>
        <p> Since some pages require the user to be authenticated, at first I basically delayed the rendering of all
            pages
            until I knew the status of the current user. For this I wrote a simple <strong>/ping</strong> API where I
            would POST the <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> and get back the user info.
        </p>
        <blockquote>Which to be honest, doesn't make any freakin sense!</blockquote>
        <p>
            I mean, I just got the static files from the server and then I have to ask the same server if I'm
            authenticated?! He should be telling me this from the very start!
        </p>
        <p>So that's what I did! First I <strong>moved the JWT</strong> token from localstorage to <strong>cookies</strong>
            so it's sent
            automatically by the
            browser. Then, on the server side, when I receive a request for the <span class="formatted">index.html</span>
            I also read the cookie and send the user info right there in HTML.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html">&#60;body>
    &#60;script>
        window.__PRELOADED_STATE__ = {
            "user": {
                "username": "iampava",
                "email": "pava@iampava.com",
                "avatarUrl": "https://iampava.com/assets/images/avatars/i_avatar.png",
                "hasFullSubscription": true,
                "notifications": {
                    "unread": "20",
                    "list": null
                }
            }
        }
    &#60;/script>
    &#60;script type="text/javascript" src="https://iampava.com/dist/devdrive.7e79696e5c8a4011ba42.js">&#60;/script>
&#60;/body></code></pre>
        <p> See what I did there? 😅 This allows the front-end to just read from the global <span class="formatted">__PRELOADED_STATE__</span>
            variable and decide
            what to do <strong>without another server request</strong>!!! In terms of actual implementations, I used
            <a href="https://lodash.com/docs/#template">lodash templates</a> to simply parse and insert some custom
            code in the HTML before sending it.
        </p>

    <section id="skeletonScreens">
        <h2>Skeleton Screens</h2>
        <p>
            And finally a technique which is more about giving the appearance of speed. Skeleton screens are about
            pre-rendering the UI before the actual data has come from the server. Many websites already do it, LinkedIn
            being the first example that comes to mind. </p>

            Although I don't have any statistics or sciency reports that
            this is better, it kinda makes sense for me because instead of a blank screen I see things happening on the
            page.

    <p> Now what? Well, let me give you a <strong>challenge</strong>! Take an idea, any idea for a
        side project
        you've got and build it while putting performance first. I learned so much by doing this that I must encourage
        you to do the same! It will be a hell of a ride 🔥
