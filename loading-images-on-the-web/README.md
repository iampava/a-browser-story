# Loading images on The Web

  
Hi! This is a simple demo of the techniques and tools I describe in my [article](https://iampava.com/blog/loading-images-on-the-web) regarding performantly loading images on The Web. 

Basically, here are actual code examples on:

* responsive images from HTML as well as CSS
* automating responsive images creation
* compressing to `webp` format using a Webpack plugin
* lazy loading
* supporting no-JS browsers


## Install


```
$ npm install
```

## Scripts

### Resize images

```
npm run resize-images
```

This will resize all the images inside the `original-images` folder and output the result into `src/images`.

### Development

```
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Production

```
npm run prod
```


## Hope it help. Cheers! ü•Ç
